Old-Random-World-Generator
==========================

This is my first attempt at a random world map generator built in Java, as part of a personal game project.  It is based on the diamon-square algorithm, and examples others have creator, incorporating terrain types, pressure, wind, and rainfall.  There are also some fantasy world options, but by default it creates a random mundane world.  I am working on making a cleaner, better version now that I have a better grasp of what I am doing..
